## The purpose of the open source team

We work across departments as internal consultants to remove barriers for contributing, producing and consuming Open
Source code.

We advise and assist on:

- Creating and nurturing Open Source communities around GfK Open Source projects
- Align community interests with GfK business interests
- Efficient and compliant adoption of Open Source code by GfK teams
- Recruiting from Open Source communities
- Best practices for applying open source to internal projects

We are also here to demystify and simply answer questions, so no matter if you are working at GfK or not, get in touch: oss@gfk.com
