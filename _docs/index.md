#### Despite widespread use, there are still many misconceptions and uncertainties for GfK employees engaging in Open Source. Questions on legal issues, licensing and what is deemed confidential or internal information is common.

This website is therefore a guide, primarily for GfK employees, on how to adopt, modify and release Open Source code. There are a few references to internal GfK sites or services, but with an effort to limit our use of internal lingo or acronyms.

#### Topics
- [Open Source Licensing Guide]({{"docs/resources/licensing" | relative_url }})
  Policies and guidance on which licenses can be used internally at GfK and in GfK open source projects

- [Adopting open source code]({{"docs/using/index" | relative_url }})
  Policies on what to be aware of when adopting open source code in a GfK project. This applies to both adding dependencies and to contributing upstream.

- [Releasing an open source project]({{"docs/releasing/index" | relative_url }})
  A step by step guide on what to do before you can release a project and guidelines on how to
