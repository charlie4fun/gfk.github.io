# Documentation

#### There are still many misconceptions and uncertainties for GfK employees engaging in Open Source. Questions on legal issues, licensing and what is deemed confidential or internal information is common.

This documentation is therefore a guide, primarily for GfK employees, on how to adopt, modify and release Open Source
code. There are a few references to internal GfK sites or services, but with an effort to limit our use of internal
lingo or acronyms.
