# The Open Source CoP

#### The Open Source Community of Practice is an autonomous employee interest group across teams and departments at GfK. Which works to scale open culture and promote best practices of Open Source development. We ensure that GfK is a good Open Source citizen, from understanding and respecting Open Source licensing to enabling GfK employees to take active part in the creation of Open Source.

## Purpose
The Open Source CoP ensure that GfK is a good Open Source citizen and that our Open Source projects live up to the highest standards, so that GfK’s Open Source efforts are recognized and promoted in the wider open source community.

## Get in touch
The Open Source CoP can be reached via [oss@gfk.com](oss@gfk.com), on [gfk.github.io](https://gfk.github.io) or in the internal Teams channel _CoP Open Source_.
