# The Open Source Review Group

#### The Open Source Review Group is a virtual team consisting of all current maintainers in the GfK Github organization. It functions as a mentor program for new projects and project maintainers.

## Purpose
- Provide an effective, responsive support group for techies to get peer feedback on OSS projects before and after publication.
- Help developers understand the security, compliance, and reputation risks around their open source projects during the entire project lifecycle.

## Membership
All active maintainers of projects in the GitHub organization [GfK SE](https://github.com/gfkse) are automatically members of the Open Source Review Group. The Open Source CoP and Open Source Review Group acts as the facilitator but are not part of the day to day mentorship and review program.

## Diversity Commitment
Diversity is a central component of GfK, as an organization of over 100 different nationalities, we acknowledge that this company would not be where it is today without the rich diversity of the people employed here.

With that said, we are very much aware that especially the technology roles at GfK and even more so open source participation in general has a very low degree of diversity. The group is therefore currently not diverse, but is tasked with a clear objective of changing this.

**The Open Source Group is committed to attract, mentor and advance any individuals open source participation, regardless of their race, sexual orientation, religion, age, gender, disability status or any other dimension of diversity.**
