# Teams and groups

#### There are teams and groups at GfK whom can help you with guidance and tools when working with open source. No matter if you are a maintainer of an open source project, or a developer adopting Open Source code, these groups are here to help.

## [Open Source Review Group](../open-source-review-group)
Works as a mentorship network for new project maintainers.

## [The Open Source CoP](../open-source-cop)
The Open Source community of practice is an informal internal group of GfK employees interested in Open Source. Anyone at GfK can join the CoP.
