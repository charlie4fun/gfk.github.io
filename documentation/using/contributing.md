# Contributing upstream

#### We encourage participation in open source projects and strive to have as few rules for this as possible, we expect GfK employees to follow common sense on what code and information they contribute - if in doubt, contact the open source team, or talk to your lead.

### Summary

* We encourage contributions upstream
* Make sure you don't share confidential information
* Don't contribute code which gives us an edge over competitors
* Only sign [whitelisted CLAs](#whitelisted-clas) - ask the open source team or legal for guidance

---

## Common contribution rules

* Do not share customer data or confidential GfK information
* Code that e.g. cannot be contributed upstream
  * confidential source code
  * recommendation algorithms
* Remember that GfK legally have ownership over your contributions as you are an employee of GfK SE

## Non-code contributions

Contributions such as reporting issues, writing documentation, reviewing code and participating
in project maintenance such as creating roadmaps, grooming backlogs etc.

These activities are all sanctioned and encouraged as part of your employment at GfK.

## Code contributions

Upstream code contributions are also encouraged and is a natural extension of our dependency of
open source projects in our tech stack. Code contributions can generally be divided into 2 categories:

* Contributions triggered by a work task: eg. a dependency have a bug or shortcoming which block your work
* Contributions on your own initiative

Both are sanctioned and does not require a review, unless repository to which you want to contribute demands otherwise.
Simply ensure that the project you are contributing to is not licensed under AGPL.

## Whitelisted CLAs
If a non-GfK open source project asks you to sign a contributor agreement, get it cleared with the open source team,
unless it is one of the following which have been whitelisted:

- Apache CLA  # TODO(charlie4fun): should following CLAs be reviewed?
- Project Harmony Contributor Agreements
- Mozilla Comitters Agreement
- Adobe Open Source Contributor Agreement
- Google iCLA
- Developer Certificate Of Origin
- Pivotal CLA
